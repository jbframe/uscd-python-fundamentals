# Question 1
# Write a Python multiprocessing program that runs all five functions below. Use a time.counter to tests the amount of time it takes all functions to run synchronously and then concurrently


# def add(x, y):

#     time.sleep(1)

#     return x + y

# def subtract(x, y):

#    time.sleep(1)
#     return x-y

# def multiply(x, y):

#    time.sleep(1)
#     return x * y

# def divide(x, y):

#     time.sleep(1)
#     if y==0:
#         raise ValueError('Cannot divide by zero!')
#     return x / y

# def modulus(x, y):

#     time.sleep(1)
#     return x % y
