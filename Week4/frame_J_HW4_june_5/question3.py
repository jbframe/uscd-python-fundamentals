# Assignment 4
# Question 3
# In this assignment you are to create a Pickle function that will take pickle the following dictionary:

# {'Colorado': 'Rockies', 'Boston': 'Red Sox', 'Minnesota': 'Twins',
# 'Milwaukee': 'Brewers', 'Seattle': 'Mariners'}
# You will then need to run a client/server socket to transfer the file from the client to the server using the following code:

#                ClientSocket.py  download   SocketServer.py  download

# Once the code is received by the server you will need to unpickle the file in order to recover the dictionary.

# Show all of your work and results with screenshots.

# ** Note: Place both the Client Server, the pickled file on the desktop. I would recommend that you place the Socket Server within a separate file on the desktop so that you don't overwrite the file you are sending.
