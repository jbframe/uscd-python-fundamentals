# Question 2
# Write a program that creates a random number from 0 to 100 and asks a user to guess it. The user, should be able to modify the number of attempts at guessing what the number is. The program should tell the user whether the number is lower or greater than the user's guess. When the user guesses the correct answer the program should tell the user he/she had won. At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get the number.
# Use the following code snippet to create the random number:   NUMBER = random.randint(MINIMUM, MAXIMUM)
