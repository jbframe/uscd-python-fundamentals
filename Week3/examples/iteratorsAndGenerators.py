#Python Generators

#The yield statement used in generators suspends a functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run.

print(next(myGenerator)) # Expected 2
print(next(myGenerator)) # Expected 3
